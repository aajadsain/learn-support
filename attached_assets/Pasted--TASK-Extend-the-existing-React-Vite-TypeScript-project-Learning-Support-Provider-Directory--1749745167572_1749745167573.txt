📌 TASK: Extend the existing React + Vite + TypeScript project (Learning Support Provider Directory) with:

🧩 NEW PAGES:
1. `/about` – About the project/team
2. `/contact` – Contact form and details

🛠 REQUIREMENTS:

1. ✅ ROUTING:
- Use React Router DOM to add 2 new routes:
  - `/about`
  - `/contact`
- Add navigation links (e.g., in a navbar or header) so users can access these pages from anywhere.

2. ✅ ABOUT PAGE (`/about`):
- Create a new file: `src/pages/About.tsx`
- Page content:
  - Heading: “About the Learning Support Directory”
  - Paragraph describing the purpose of the project (supporting students with learning needs like ADHD, Dyslexia, etc.)
  - Optional: Section about the team or vision
  - Use TailwindCSS to style the page cleanly and responsively

3. ✅ CONTACT PAGE (`/contact`):
- Create a new file: `src/pages/Contact.tsx`
- Page content:
  - Heading: “Contact Us”
  - Show email and phone support details
  - Add a working contact form with fields: Name, Email, Message
  - On submit, just log the form data to console (no backend needed)
  - Add basic validation (required fields)
  - Make the layout responsive with TailwindCSS

4. ✅ COMPONENTS (optional but preferred):
- `Navbar.tsx` (add Home, About, Contact links)
- `Footer.tsx` if you want to include contact info or links again at bottom

5. ✅ QUALITY:
- Use reusable components
- Clean responsive design
- Add Tailwind utility classes for padding, margin, spacing
- Add TypeScript interfaces where needed
- Proper error handling if form fields are empty

👉 DELIVERABLES:
- `src/pages/About.tsx`  
- `src/pages/Contact.tsx`  
- Updated routes in `App.tsx`  
- `Navbar.tsx` or equivalent layout component with links  
- Contact form with basic validation + console output  
- Responsive UI for both pages

🎯 GOAL:
Make this a professional, production-ready UI with proper navigation and full informational content for a real-world feel. Generate all required code files with full content and styling.
