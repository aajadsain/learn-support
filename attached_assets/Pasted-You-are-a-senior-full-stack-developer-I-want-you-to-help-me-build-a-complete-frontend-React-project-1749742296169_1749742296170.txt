You are a senior full-stack developer. I want you to help me build a complete frontend React project with the following requirements:

üß© PROJECT NAME: Learning Support Provider Directory

üîß STACK: Use React with Vite. TypeScript preferred. TailwindCSS for styling. Use React Router for page navigation.

üìÅ FEATURES:
1. Project Setup:
   - Use Vite to create a new React + javascript project. 
   - Configure TailwindCSS with PostCSS and autoprefixer.
   - Add folder structure for `components`, `pages`, `data`, `utils`.

2. Data Simulation (API):
   - Create a `providers.json` file with 5-7 learning support provider objects.
   - Each object must have:
     - id, name, specialization, location, rating (1-5), shortDescription, longDescription, contactEmail, phoneNumber.
   - Simulate API using `setTimeout` and Promises in a utility file (`utils/fetchProviders.ts`).

3. Pages:
   A. `/` or `/providers`: **Provider Listing Page**
     - Fetch and display the list of providers.
     - Show: name, specialization, location, rating.
     - Each card must link to a detailed view.
     - Add a search/filter input that filters by name or specialization.
     - Use a responsive card layout using Tailwind.
   
   B. `/providers/:id`: **Provider Detail Page**
     - Fetch the single provider by ID.
     - Display all data fields.
     - Show fallback UI if not found.
     - Add "Back to List" button.

4. Components:
   - `ProviderCard.tsx`: Renders one provider's preview.
   - `SearchInput.tsx`: Controlled input for filtering.
   - Reusable layout elements if needed.

5. Routing:
   - Set up routing with React Router v6.
   - Handle 404 or not-found provider in detail view.

6. Code Quality:
   - Use functional components and React Hooks.
   - Separate concerns into components and utility functions.
   - Add comments where necessary.

7. Git:
   - Initialize Git repo.
   - Include a `README.md` with:
     - Project overview, tech stack, setup instructions, and folder structure.

üì¶ DELIVERABLES:
- Complete project folder structure with working code.
- All files should be production-quality.
- README.md file with setup steps (`npm install`, `npm run dev`).

Please generate all files and code needed. Assume I will copy-paste and run it directly. If needed, break into logical sections with file names and full code blocks.
